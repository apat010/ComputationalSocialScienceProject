You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em on it
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Taking these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the morning
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performing
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta, where young niggas run shit
I know they hating on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she coming
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't running

Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doing all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid

Diamonds dancing in the dial, like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GunWun not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches getting saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lacking, why I'm working on my aim
Drip too hard (too hard), charge it to the card (to the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names (uh)

My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start

Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights, and then it all got dark

I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true

I hear planes flying, crowds screaming, money counters, chains clanging
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winning
I ain't joking, do it sound like I'm kidding?
I've been making like 2000 a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimming
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

When I'm finished, when I'm finished

I got a man, but I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick making me think 'bout someone new
You know, I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through that I just wanna get with you

And you're right
You right, I got my guy
But I, I can't help it, I want you
Said, you right, I got my guy
But I, I can't help it, I want you

I can't stop and look the other way
'Cause I know what could be, babe, and you'd never feel the same
You'd be thinking 'bout it every day
Don't believe in fairy tales, but we got our fantasies

And it's me and you, no, she tryna be all through your sheets
Have you all on top of me, acting like it's not that deep
Boy, you can take it off of me, tell me what it's 'bout to be
Really feel it's bound to be, I can't tell no one but they all know

I got a man, but I want you
I got a man, but I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick making me think 'bout someone new

Said, you right, I got my guy

Girl, I want you like you want me to
I feel that energy (oh, yeah)
When you're on top of me (oh, yeah)
I know your man, he ain't controlling you
But you still hesitate
'Cause you choose loyalty (oh, yeah)

And I know your history (hey)
Met him before your peak (hey)
He's so connected to that woman that you used to be
But-but-but this sex will cloud your memory
A couple strokes, I'll put it in, then you'll belong to me

I got a man, but I want you
I got a man, but I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick making me think 'bout someone new
You know, I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through that I just wanna get with you

And you're right
You right, I (right) got my guy (I got my-)
But I, I (but I) can't help it, I want you
Said, you right, I (yeah) got my guy (yeah)

Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name outta your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal

So, go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough
They don't call my bluff 'cause I hate to find

Rather you remain unremarkable

When they say your name, I just act confused

Did you have fun?

And she make me breakfast almost every morning (every morning)
And she take a naked pic' before she leave the door
I be waking up to pics' before a nigga yawning

And every weekend my shawty comin' over (over)
Shawty could Fendi out, but she like Fashion Nova (Nova)
She ain't driving no Camry, she pullin' in a Rover (Rover)
With her hair so curly, I love you, baby

I got what you need (oh)
Walk up in the store and get what you want (go get it)
You get what you please
We 'bout to get it on, take off them drawers (I said I love you, baby)
It's just you and me
You know what I be on, I'm about to go raw (love you, baby)
'Cause I like what I see

Look, baby, I said I ain't gon' front
You got my heart beating so fast to words I can't pronounce
And I be getting the chills every time I feel your touch
I be looking at the top and girl, it's only us

All I need is your trust
And girl I told you once, don't make me tell you twice
I know you see this print through my pants that I know you like
And yo' ass be looking so fat when it be in them tights
And I'm going straight to the top, so hope you ain't afraid of heights

You always treat me right, for a fact, you never left
Through all the trials and tribulations, always had my best
So here's 55 hunnid, go and get your breasts
Start rubbin' on your butt, start kissing on yo' neck

I had to apply the pressure, 'cause you my hidden treasure

Heat, heat waves, I'm swimming in a mirror
Road shimmer, wiggling the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a-

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually, I put something on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen

You just need a better life than this
You need something I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say something so loving, but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off with someone new

I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

I just wonder what you're dreaming of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Heat waves been faking me out

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
